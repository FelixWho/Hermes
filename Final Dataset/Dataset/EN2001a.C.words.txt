the basic word importance is off-line as well the combined measure might not be if we want to wait what the user has typed in into the search yeah i'm not quite so what it did you want to do it i you just wanted to assign uh i thought about words mm mm okay yeah but how about those words which don't carry any meaning at all the um and uhs and something like that because if we if we average average over over a whole utterance all the words and there are quite unimportant words in there but quite important words as well i think we should just disregard the the okay alright yeah but there is no i_d_ for an utterance i think it's just for individual words so how do we do that then we for utterances as well i think it's just for one word so we have to yeah uh i'm not quite sure i have only seen that the uh the individual words have got an i_d_ yeah you always could have a look at the time stamps and then take the ones that uh belong together to form an utterance yeah if they are already there's it's easy but it would be possible uh yeah okay you s uh you said you are currently in uh implementing the idea what exactly are you computing okay okay mm-hmm mm-hmm yeah i w i w i would need the raw text pretty soon because i have to find out um how i have to put the segments into bins and then yeah no that's not necessary yes i did but um i've only just got the notes i have to still have uh to order everything by the time and yeah i think it's quite easy after the yeah yeah so uh mm-hmm yeah b i uh w that's what i was uh thought that you just combine them and then order the time stamps accordingly okay um what i found out was that there are quite a lot of things without without s time stamps in the beginning yeah and uh x_m_l_ files yeah that's just an i_d_ or something i don't know just numbers yes but what are the other things that's uh some kind of number f maybe the file number or something that is in the beginning what is that do you know um i think there are quite a lot of numbers in the beginning where n there is no time stamp for the numbers it's think they say um quite a lot of numbers and before that uh um there's this number was it yeah there i are numbers in the um the w_ tag but there are no time stamps yeah yeah in the beginning as well sometimes i think at least i saw some yeah yeah but what it is it actually that numbers okay so but there are no time stamps annotated to that it's it's quite strange and also um there are different um combinations of letters b_r_e_ and something like that is it everything ordered are the time stamps global or uh are they local at any point okay yeah it's rainbow it's um i think it's just the dictionary in the first place but um no i have to bin it up and so i will only have counts for each each bin or something it's because um rainbow is a text classification system and i think it's not possible to have just one class that's the problem maybe we could yeah sure you sure we could do that but i don't that makes sense if we need just frequencies maybe we should just calculate them by using perl or something i don't know yeah it's quite easy to just count and s or sort them by um frequency just using a perl script is it too big yeah hmm i don't know how you how many terms you can handle in perl mm yeah uh i can get all the raw text but it has to be ordered still so no it isn't um it's in what is implemented in rainbow is information gain and i'm not quite sure how they calculate that yeah uh that's what rainbow does i think you j can just get probabilities for a certain words for each document certain um we would have to look at that mm-hmm oh yeah that's what i thought as well that you that probably the the topic segment level is the most um informative for the words yeah that's the problem i don't know mm-hmm so shall we sit together tomorrow then as well uh okay um yeah w would it be best at the moment it's it's just lines of mm-hmm um okay so um you'd do you extract the words the raw text as well uh okay mm-hmm print out okay okay that okay so have we already extracted from all the files yeah did you also order mm-hmm hmm hmm okay uh i don't need the times i just need the words but um yeah in the right order yes yeah that doesn't matter too much i think hmm mm-hmm how long would it take to make the frequency counts with a java hash table yeah no how long you would have to program something okay mm because it's quite easy in perl as well it's just a line of code for counting all the words and yeah it's it's by hashes yeah yeah 'kay
